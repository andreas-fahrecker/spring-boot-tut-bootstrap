# Spring Boot Tutorial Bootstrap

This is a studying repo, for myself to get back into java and spring, after not using that stack for quiet some time.

This Repo is based on https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start and instead of a book db I created a movie db. Also,
this program seems to work when testing with postman. But I didn't quite get JUnit with RestAssured to work in IntelliJ
or with Maven.
